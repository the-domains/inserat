            <description><![CDATA[<p>This is some random text Have your own domain? You can use it! This video will show you how to point your domain to us. You'll be able to do this by creating an A record and adding 52.32.215.222 as the IP. If your domain calls for a host, please enter "@". Once you have the A record set on the DNS settings of your domain registrar's panel, you'll want to configure your settings in the Info tab of your site. In the URL field, enter your domain. It should be formatted like this: http://domain.com (please don't include www.). Also, in order to have your domain display on its new home you'll also want to make sure that you have at least one post published to your site. If you still hit a snag, please email us in a screenshot of your DNS settings and your Info tab of your site to support@thegrid.io</p>]]></description>
